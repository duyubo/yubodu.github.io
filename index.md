## About Me

I am Yongbin Feng (冯永彬 in Chinese), a postdoctoral research associate at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory studying experimental particle physics (HEP-ex). More information can be found in my CV [<a href="files/cv/cv_feng.pdf">here</a>].

## Education

- <em>Physics Ph.D.</em>: **University of Maryland, College Park**, Maryland, USA, 08/2015 - 10/2020
- <em>Physics B.S.</em>: **University of Science and Technology of China**, Hefei, Anhui, China, 08/2011 - 06/2015

## Research Interests

- **High Precision Electroweak Measurements:** W and Z cross sections, differential cross sections, etc
- **SONIC:** Services of Network Inferences on Coprocessors
- **Machine Learning Application in HEP:** pileup mitigation, missing transverse momentum regression
- **DarkQuest:** proton fixed-target experiment to search for light dark matter
