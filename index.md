## About Me

I am Yubo Du, a Ph.D. graduate student researcher at University of Pittsburgh. I joined Dr. Jun Yang's lab since Jan 2023. My interests lie in defending the programs against memory safety-related bugs/exploitations such as Use-AFter-Free detection and Out-of-Bounds detection.  

## Education

- <em>Computer Science M.S.</em>: **Vanderbilt University**, Nashville, TN, USA, Jan. 2020 - Dec. 2021
- <em>Physics B.S.</em>: **University of Science and Technology of China**, Hefei, Anhui, China, Aug. 2014 - Jun. 2018

## Work Experience
- **Research Assistant** at <em>Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences</em>
<br> 
Shenzhen, P.R.China, Sep. 2018 - Apr. 2019

## Research Interests

- **Memory Safety:** Defending C/C++ Programs against memory safety-related bugs/exploitations.
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimizing the performance of software-based memory safety sanitizers.
